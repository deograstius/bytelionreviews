- This is a project to test out my ReactNative skills.

## How to run:

- Since the project is using yarn and expo use `yarn install; yarn start` instead of `npx react-native start`
- Make sure to run `cd ios; pod install; cd ..` in order to set up ios to run.
- Run `npx react-native run-android` for android or `npx react-native run-ios` for ios.
- If you're using openjdk 16, you may have to run android run from Android Studio.
